Graduation Project from DEPI for Autodesk 3D designer track (3ds Max)

Origin of the Idea: Handmade crafts in Aswan often draw inspiration from Nubian heritage. This includes distinctive patterns, bright colors, and traditional materials like clay, wood, and natural fibers. Artisans in Aswan frequently use local materials like sandstone, granite, and natural dyes. Modern designers in Aswan often blend traditional craft methods with contemporary design. We wanted to merge the rich cultural legacy of Nubian people with ancient Egyptian heritage.

Our project mission was to bring the rich legacy of Aswan’s traditional handmade crafts and ancient Egyptian heritage into the digital age, preserving and showcasing local artistry and ancient temples through immersive 3D models that connect global audiences to the region's cultural legacy for tourism revitalization. To digitally capture and preserve the intricate details of Aswan’s handmade crafts, ensuring their cultural significance is archived for future generations. Promotion: To provide a platform for artisans by showcasing their work in a visually engaging 3D format that reaches wider, international audiences. Innovation: To integrate modern technology with traditional craftsmanship, offering unique digital representations that can be used for education, tourism, and design inspiration. Sustainability: To promote sustainable practices by using digital tools to reduce waste in material production while maintaining the integrity of handmade craft designs.

Aswan is known for its pottery, particularly with intricate carvings and natural colors, so we made a pottery shop showcasing this craft. The textile art in Aswan features colorful handwoven carpets and textiles with traditional patterns, so we made a local carpet shop. Also, Aswan is known for palm products, so handmade wicker plates to bring attention to Nubian crafts. Aswan has Philae Temple, so we tried to replicate it and added kiosks with local crafts to advertise and strengthen the bond between the Nubian people's culture and ancient Egyptian monuments.

We used 3ds Max for modeling, V-Ray for rendering and DaVinci Resolve for video editing.

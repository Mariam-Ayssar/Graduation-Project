Graduation Project from DEPI
Origin of the Idea: Handmade crafts in Aswan often draw inspiration from Nubian heritage. This includes distinctive patterns, bright colors, and traditional materials like clay, wood, and natural fibers. Artisans in Aswan frequently use local materials like sandstone, granite, and natural dyes. Modern designers in Aswan often blend traditional craft methods with contemporary design. We wanted to merge the rich cultural legacy of Nubian people with ancient egyptian heritage.
Our project mission was to bring the rich legacy of Aswanâ€™s traditional handmade crafts and ancient egyptian heritage into the digital age, preserving and showcasing local artistry and ancient temples through immersive 3D models that connect global audiences to the region's cultural legacy for tourism revitalization. We made a local carpet shop and handmade wicker plates to bring attention to Nubian crafts and an ancient egyptian temple with kiosks with local crafts to advertise and strenghten the bond between the Nubian people culture and ancient egyptian monuments.
